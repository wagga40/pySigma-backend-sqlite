# Migrating to backend 2.x

Regenerate saved SQL and rulesets after upgrading; the package does not rewrite
SQL produced by an older version. Update any consumer that runs correlation
output before giving it 2.x rulesets.

## From 1.x to 2.0

**Configuration**

- Requires pySigma >=1.5.1,<2 and Python 3.10+ (2.1 raises both, see below).
  Correlations need SQLite 3.38+ with JSON functions.
- The default table is `logs` in both output formats.
- Options are constructor keywords (see the README's Options). Point
  `timestamp_field` and `event_id_field` at your schema.
- On tables without `NOCASE` columns, set `collate_nocase=True` so string
  equality ignores case.

**Correlation results**

- A grouped correlation used to return one row per group for the whole input,
  such as `{"Host": "h"}`, hiding separate bursts. Each qualifying occurrence is
  now a row with its window, metric and evidence ([output format](output-format.md)).
- `metric_value` is the count or statistic; `event_count` counts supporting events.
- Counts and statistics look backward from each event; absence looks forward.
  With values 0 at t=0 and 100 at t=3, the average at t=3 is now 50, not 100.
  See [correlations](correlations.md).
- String group keys are lowercased and nested in `group_keys`.
- `generate: true` used to expose raw predicates; it now emits valid standalone
  queries.

**Consumers**

- Add missing columns from `required_fields` (or `runtime.ensure_fields`) rather
  than by scanning SQL text, which misses fields inside functions and CTEs.
- Run `correlation_plan` with `runtime.execute_plan` for indexed execution and
  event evidence. `rule` still holds standalone `SELECT` statements.
- Don't skip a rule because its `channel` list is empty.

## From 2.0 to 2.1

- Requires pySigma 2.x and Python 3.11+.
- Keyword rules convert when `fulltext_field` is set; their entries use
  `schema_version: 3` ([keyword search](keyword-search.md)). Other output keeps
  version 2.
- IPv6 CIDR values follow pySigma 2's narrower expansion (19 SigmaHQ rules
  change), and a CIDR expanding to several patterns inside an AND is now
  parenthesized; before, it could match events failing the rest of the AND.
- A `value_count` over a list of fields raises
  `SigmaFeatureNotSupportedByBackendError` instead of a `TypeError`.
